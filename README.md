# Digit-Recognizer-using-CNN

Implemented a CNN from scratch using NumPy. 

The neural network consisted of a convolutional layer,  maxpooling layer,  fully connected layer and a classification layer with squared loss function.  

Backpropagation algorithm was used for feature extraction. The training method is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. 

The model was trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
